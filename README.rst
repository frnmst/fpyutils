fpyutils
========

A collection of useful non-standard Python functions which aim to be simple to
use, highly readable but not efficient.


    >>> from fpyutils import filelines


Conventions
-----------

PEP-8
Use ``flake8`` to check the code.

For each module ``m.py``, it exists, if necessary, its utility file called 
``_m.py``
